Create an RFM Model by:
Create the amount the amount spent column
create a pivot table to aggregate the data with the customer id, sum of amount spent, count of invoice no., Max of InvoiceDate
copy from the pivot table into another sheet (analysis) and rename as follows: sum of amount spent (Monetary), count of invoice no. (Frequency), and from the Max of InvoiceDate & Current Date column create the Recency column, using the DATEDIF() function, to form the RFM variables.
create a score column for each variable (Monetary score, Frequency score, and Recency score) using the PERCENTRANK.INC function
Create an RFM column to sum the total of scores for each raw.
Create an RFM Score column to rank the sum of scores
Create a lookuptable with the different customer segments (Top Customers, Loyal Customers, At Risk/Need Attention, Immediate Attention), of which the newly created column "Segment Name" will fetch the customer segment from the lookup table.
